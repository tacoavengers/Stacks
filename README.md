# Stacks
Stacks

### How it works

Stack is a data structure that works on the LIFO model: Last In First Out.    
It works on ```push``` (e.g., append) and ```pop```

#### Example

```
stack = []

stack.append(10)
stack.append(20)
stack.append(30)

print(stack) // [10, 20, 30]

stack.pop()
print(stack) // [10, 20]
```
